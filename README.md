# Awesome Image Animations

This project demonstrates two awesome image animations using CSS keyframes. It includes rotating an image continuously and scaling an image up and down repeatedly.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Place your desired images in the same directory as the HTML file.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Animation Details

### Image Rotation

The `animationroate.webp` file is animated with a continuous rotation effect. It rotates in a linear motion, completing a full 360-degree rotation over a period of 5 seconds.

### Image Scaling

The `animationtransform.jpg file is animated with a scaling effect. It grows to 1.2 times its original size and then shrinks back to its original size repeatedly. The animation lasts for 3 seconds and uses an ease-in-out timing function.

## Customization

You can customize the animations by modifying the CSS code in the `index.html` file. Adjust the animation properties such as duration, timing, and transformations to achieve different effects. You can also replace the image files with your own images by updating the image paths in the HTML file.

## Requirements

To run the animations, you need a web browser that supports CSS3 and keyframe animations.

## Credits

This project is created using HTML and CSS animations. It utilizes the power of CSS keyframes to bring life to images.
